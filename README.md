Best seller's list

First app to check out node.

It gets the best sellers from the NY Times and displays a nice picture and a link to buy it in Amazon.

The Amazon's links might not work due to how I built them. I just used the unique book identifier to construct a url but the result is not all the urls are valid.

You can see a working demo here: http://popularbooksbookstore.herokuapp.com/
